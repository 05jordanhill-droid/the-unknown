            <h2>Official Numbering System</h2>
            <p>Human-like beings in this Reality have 4 fingers on each hand (A nod to the fact that their Reality is more “animated” than ours), so their number system is in base 8 rather than base 10. The best way for us to do math would be to just translate the number given in base-8 to base-10.</p>
            <p>Even though the first Humans there had 5 fingers on each hand and used the base-10 system, their children and onward they had 4 fingers on each hand. Base-10 is present in this world due to that but only for the measurement of time, except in use for Cosmic ID in which it uses base-8. Base-10 is also represented with the same characters as we know them while they show the base-8 with unique characters to differentiate when they are used.</p>

            <h2>Official Timekeeping System</h2>
            <p>***Base-10***</p>
            <p>20 Years = Human Adult (Approx. 19 Years old for us)</p>
            <p>100 Days per Year</p>
            <p>30 Hours per Day</p>
            <p>100 Minutes per Hour</p>
            <p>100 Seconds per Minute</p>
            <p>The first Humans put here constructed a massive beacon and an even bigger half circle that revolves around it to create the illusion of day and night.</p>
            <h3>There are 3 parts to a full day:</h3>
            <p>1/3: Tail end of Night time and first half of Day time</p>
            <p>2/3: Second half of Day time and tail beginning of Night time</p>
            <p>3/3: Majority of Night time</p>
