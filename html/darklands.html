        <h1>The Darklands</h1>
        <p>The light that comes from the beacon of the citadel is not regular light. If it were then the light would either be too dim to light up so much land that it does or it would be too bright to live in the Citadel. To solve this, the Ancient Humans made a new structure for light in a hexagonal structure rather than a photon. This hexagonal structure allows light to be spread out evenly with everywhere that it touches. So instead of the light fading into darkness, it keeps going at an evenly distributed light level and then all at once the light cuts out completely. The point in which the light cuts out entirely is known as the Darklands. Few people know what is out there. To go out there would be as if to remove your eyes and become blind.</p>
        <p>The majority of the populations do not know of this land due to how far the light stretches, but the Ancient Humans technically know of it since they know that the light of their beacon can't go on infinitely, despite it's extremely far reach.</p>
