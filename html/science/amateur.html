                <p>As the full science structure of things is not wide spread knowledge due to the fact that the Infinite Reality has no form of 'free knowledge' or internet with easily accessible knowledge. So oftentimes people will have a misunderstood idea of science, even if it makes sense it's still misunderstood. Below is the structure of the “science” commonly accepted among most Artificers. Typically only high end scientists hold a full knowledge of the structure of science.</p>
                <p>Due to the use of “Magic” there are ways to pause the instability crumbling from any atomic structure. This allows for the combination of any 2 Elements to create a corresponding element.</p>

                    <h2>Intensity</h2>
                    <p>Intensity is a measure of a naturally occurring surge from Reality. These surges can be recreated using various forms of magic but cannot be recreated via science, due to this fact the surges are deemed as “magical”. Despite the surges being “magical” the objects affected by this are used in science. Since these surges occur naturally, Artificers have agreed that the objects as a result are of the Natural Elements in the table below.</p>
                    <p>Compressed Gas >>> Liquid</p>
                    <p>Compressed Liquid >>> Solid</p>

                    <h2>Natural “Elements”</h2>
                    <p>Green Categorized “Elements”: Elements that are naturally occurring (or even possible) in our Reality.</p>
                    <p>Orange Categorized “Elements”: “Elements” capable of changing or being made from another “Element” via Heat or Cold.</p>
                    <p>Not Green “Elements”: Elements that are a product of Reality's “Intensity Surges”.</p>
                    <p>As you Increase or decrease the Intensity in a Natural “Element” it will go through each Element either down or up until you reach your desired “Element”.</p>
                    <p>Heat and Cold are a common way to move one Natural “Element” to another without Intensity manipulation, though it doesn't take you Element by Element in a gradient as shown in the chart as Intensity manipulation would, rather it takes you to a specific Element. </p>
                    <p>If the method of finding one of these “Elements” is not specified then it will likely be obtainable wherever the things it's based on is found, but it will VERY likely be harder to find than the thing it is based on.</p>
                </div>
                <section>
                    <p>Toxic Sludge: Increased Intensity in Ice overloads it and it shifts into a thick, molasses-like sludge that breaks down heavy substances until it matches its own weight. You can cool down Acid to obtain Toxic Sludge. Or you can heat Toxic Sludge to obtain Acid.</p>
                    <p>Hungry Ice: Decreased Intensity in Ice drains it of its own external properties and will consume abstract material such as language. It is capable of overlaying instructions carved into it toward another Natural “Element” of a lesser density to have it act in the way the instructions say. The instructions can't have a Natural “Element” do something that doesn't make sense (Ex: Frozen Fire to move, Liquid Electricity to burn, Liquid Fire to electrocute, etc…).</p>
                    <p>Frozen Electricity: While this term is semi-recreatable with Science, it does not hold the same properties. Frozen Electricity as created by Science behaves closer to Electricity as found in our Reality, whereas Frozen Electricity created via Intensity manipulation has the Frozen Electricity hold very different properties. Frozen Electricity stores all electrical shocks put towards it and will not release them until thawed out into Liquid Electricity.</p>
                    <p>Frozen Air: Frozen Air is air that feels and acts almost like water while keeping the appearance of Air. It is still light enough to float but tends to group with other Frozen Air. If you try to breathe it you will accidentally swallow it as that is the only way to force it down your throat and you will likely wind up throwing it back up as it is too light to continue down the digestive tract but too heavy to come back up on its own by burping.</p>
                    <p>Frozen Fire: Frozen Fire stores all kinetic energy and heat applied to it until thawed out into Liquid Fire. The Frozen Fire looks like Fire except it is Frozen in place and feels cold since when you touch it, it will absorb the heat your body emits.</p>
                    <p>Liquid Earth: Liquid Earth is capable of absorbing all kinetic energy applied to it but rather than storing it, it will disperse it back into the one that created the kinetic energy. Punching it will delve your fist into it like liquid but the kinetic energy will still be dispersed back into your arm (Or whatever part of you is outside the liquid). If the creator of the kinetic energy is completely submerged in the liquid then the kinetic energy will first be dispersed into anything only partially in it and then if there are no objects only partially in, then it will simply disperse it into the air.</p>
                    <p>Liquid Obsidian: Liquid Obsidian holds all the same properties of Obsidian except in liquid form. The Intensity of Obsidian cannot be manipulated by anyone except Reality or an Elemental whose body is part of that Obsidian. This is due to the fact that Intensity manipulation is “Magic” and Obsidian is not affected by “Magic”. So the only way for some to obtain it is by finding it as a naturally occurring substance. </p>
                    <p>Acid: While Acid is creatable in our Reality, it is not naturally occurring and does not act the same in reactions. Acid will consume any substance to nothing unless the atomic structure exceeds that of an Ionic Crystal structure, at which point its effectiveness begins to dwindle drastically. </p>
                    <p>Water lite: Water lite is very similar to regular Water except that when anything touches it, its polarity will become opposite to the polarity of the object touching it, so it will not stick to it in any way. Furthermore, it is completely inert in all temperature facets. So by touching it you have no way of telling that you are touching it other than your sight and even that can be difficult if the Water lite is clear.</p>
                    <p>Liquid Electricity: While this term is semi-recreatable with Science, it does not hold the same properties. Liquid Electricity as created by Science behaves closer to Electricity as found in our Reality, whereas Liquid Electricity created via Intensity manipulation has the Liquid Electricity hold very different properties. Liquid Electricity will absorb any and all electrical pulses produced toward it, but if touched by anything it will expend all of that electricity stored into that object that touched it regardless of conductivity. If there was enough electricity present then it could explode the item. By heating up the Liquid Electricity without touching it it can boil into plain Electricity. If you cool it down, it will freeze into Frozen Electricity.</p>
                    <p>Liquid Fire: Liquid Fire is very similar to Frozen Fire in that it will store any heat or kinetic energy applied to it but it differs in that it will also expend any heat or kinetic energy toward anything that touches it. So if you stick your hand in it will absorb and apply heat at the same rate and thus temperature-wise nothing would change but if you don't keep your hand moving to create kinetic energy then the Liquid Fire will absorb you of your energy until you either produce more kinetic energy by moving your hand or by simply removing your hand. Liquid Fire can be heated to create regular Fire or it can be cooled to create Frozen Fire.</p>
                    <p>Gaseous Earth: Gaseous Earth will absorb any nongaseous matter that touches it until it regains liquid status unless that matter is a Transition Metal. Due to this it can be found in various metal ore deposits.</p>
                    <p>Gaseous Lava: Gaseous Lava is very similar to regular Magma but in this gaseous form its burning effect starts off a bit slower, but once the gas has started burning away at whatever material the further burning will increasingly grow in speed and damage.</p>
                    <p>Gaseous Obsidian: Gaseous Obsidian holds all the same properties of Obsidian except in gaseous form. The Intensity of Obsidian cannot be manipulated by anyone except Reality or an Elemental whose body is part of that Obsidian. This is due to the fact that Intensity manipulation is “Magic” and Obsidian is not affected by “Magic”. So the only way for some to obtain it is by finding it as a naturally occurring substance. </p>
                    <p>Gaseous Acid: Gaseous Acid acts the same as regular Acid except it is attracted to other gaseous materials until it comes into contact with a surface to which it will bond with it and attempt to insert into any crevices or any molecular gaps to break it down from the inside. This allows it to break down atomic structures of Atomic Nuclei structure or weaker if it is able to penetrate the material as described.</p>
                    <p>Floating Water: Floating Water has no tactile feeling to it and no temperature effect on any outside thing. Floating Water will stick to materials and loosen the atomic structure of it to create molecular gaps in the structure. The denser the material the longer it takes for the Floating Water to effectively loosen the materials structure.</p>
