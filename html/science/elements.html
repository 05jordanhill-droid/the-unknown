                <p>Core Concept: These metals undergo a complete atomic destabilization when electrified, leading to continuous absorption of heat to compensate for the energy loss.</p>
                <p>The reaction occurs as soon as the electricity touches the metal in which the electricity spreads with speed comparable to flash paper. This means that the first burst of electricity will determine the intensity of the reaction.</p>
                <p>Behavior:</p>
                <section>
                    <p>Heat Absorption: As the atomic structure breaks down, it creates a "vacuum" effect, drawing in heat from the environment. This compensates for the inability of the metal to retain energy internally.</p>
                    <p>Deconstruction: Over time, the material disintegrates as more atomic bonds are broken, reducing the metal to nothing.</p>
                    <p>Density & Reactivity:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>Denser Metals: Last longer due to stronger atomic frameworks.</p>
                        <p>More Reactive Metals: Absorb heat more intensely due to greater initial instability in their atomic structure.</p>
                    </section>
                </section>
                <p>Extent of the property: This effect can range anywhere from only cold enough to sting when touching for too long to produce enough cold to supercool Nonmetals.</p>
                
                <p>Alkaline Metals Special Reaction: Alkaline Metals being more stable than Alkali Metals are able to hold a structural bond rather than collapsing entirely if the triggering electricity exceeds the Coulomb barrier. Upon collapsing rather than the electrons crashing into and destroying the nucleus, they bind to it. But if the electricity doesn't exceed the Coulomb barrier then the material reacts the same as Alkali Metals.</p>
                <section>
                    <p>This collapsed atomic makeup makes an INCREDIBLY dense and sharply precise material. The electrons being bound to the nucleus prevents the material from heating or cooling down.</p>

                <p>Core Concept: These metals maintain indefinite malleability, becoming soft and moldable while retaining structural integrity under certain conditions.</p>
                <p>The reaction occurs as soon as the electricity touches the metal in which the electricity spreads with speed comparable to flash paper. This means that the first burst of electricity will determine the intensity of the reaction.</p>
                <p>Behavior:</p>
                <section>
                    <p>Malleability: Clay-Metals become fluid and pliable when bent or reshaped, but they temporarily harden upon impacts. This allows for adaptive shaping but limits susceptibility to external damage.</p>
                    <p>Oxidation:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>Frequent Bending: Introduces vulnerabilities through oxidation, which must be mitigated (e.g., polishing or protective coatings).</p>
                    </section>
                    <p>Properties by Density & Reactivity:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>Denser Metals: Require more force to shape, making them durable.</p>
                        <p>More Reactive Metals: Bend more fluidly but oxidize faster, risking eventual breakage.</p>
                    </section>
                </section>
                <p>Examples: Post-transition metals and metalloids (e.g., Aluminum, Tin, Lead).</p>
                <p>Visual: A Clay-Metal shines with a liquid-like luster when bent, gradually dimming as oxidation sets in.</p>
                <p>Use Cases: Adaptive materials for construction, tools, and creative applications like morphing armor or flexible conduits.</p>

                <p>Post-Transition Metals Special Reaction: Post-Transition Metals once becoming Clay-Metal hold a special reaction upon coming to contact with E-Waves. E-waves Wave 3 communication can command Post-Transition Clay-Metals to configure in any manner whether that be purely physical, changing states of matter, or both. Depending on the complexity of the Wave 3 it can command specific movements from the Metal or even specific behaviors.</p>

                <p>Core Concept: These metals expel heat as they cycle through unstable electron behavior when electrified, temporarily becoming heat generators.</p>
                <p>The reaction occurs as soon as the electricity touches the metal in which the electricity spreads with speed comparable to flash paper. This means that the first burst of electricity will determine the intensity of the reaction.</p>
                <p>Behavior:</p>
                <section>
                    <p>Heat Expulsion: The erratic electron movement releases energy as heat, which radiates outward. This process continues until the electrons stabilize, returning the metal to its original state.</p>
                    <p>Duration:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>Denser Metals: Hold this state longer due to greater energy absorption capacity.</p>
                        <p>More Reactive Metals: Produce more intense heat, though they return to normal more quickly.</p>
                    </section>
                </section>
                <p>Visual: A Thermo-Metal glows red, orange, or white as it radiates heat, with shimmering waves of distortion visible around it. When the reaction ends, it cools and returns to its original solid form.</p>
                <p>Use Cases: Energy generation, thermal weaponry, or as heat reservoirs for industrial processes.</p>

                <p>Lanthanoids Metals Special Reaction: Lanthanoids being more reactive and less structurally sound have a specific reaction when shocked with electricity that induces a temperature change enough that the metal is affected nigh all at once to the 10th degree rather than noticeably affecting from outside in. In reaching this the electrons of the electricity begins exciting every electron of the metal at once allowing them to orbit each other and cause a chain reaction in which the structure reconfigures itself to bloat outwards while maintaining a solid status so the overall metal becomes hollow with the expanding force bloating with enough force to transfer any kinetic energy it produces to anything it comes into contact with rather than the material itself. The metal will expand with this speed until the atoms are stretched until right before liquid status in which the energy has been exhausted from the outward push and the material settled in the new configuration. </p>
                <section>
                    <p>This new structure is incredibly difficult to break because any force applied will be distributed throughout the whole material due to its perfectly expanded shape. If a any disturbance in this structure is created then the materials structural integrity becomes compromised and becomes very easy to break (at least in comparison to before the hole was made; the actual easiness of continuing to break depends on the material itself), much like an arch distributing high amounts of pressure on itself.</p>

                <p>Properties of Actinoids in the ORC Reality:</p>
                <section>
                    <p>Kinetic Force Trigger:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>Actinoids in the ORC Reality are triggered into a reactive state when a certain level of kinetic force is applied. The greater the atomic number, the less kinetic force is required to initiate the reaction.</p>
                        <p>Upon triggering, the Actinoid becomes increasingly unstable and begins to consume oxygen particles to stabilize itself. This leads to a struggle for balance, as the structure of the Actinoid breaks down but is temporarily stabilized by the absorption of oxygen.</p>
                    </section>
                    <p>Oxygen Absorption and Structure Breakdown:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>The Actinoids' instability causes them to suck in oxygen as they attempt to maintain their structure. As they absorb oxygen the heat and energy is drained from the Oxygen, they gain temporary structural stability from the energy sucked and the physical Oxygen particle that is now supercooled due to having all of its energy drained suddenly.</p>
                        <p>However, this stability is short-lived, and the Actinoid will break down rapidly, continuing to consume oxygen until it either runs out or the structure becomes unsustainable and it crumbles.</p>
                    </section>
                    <p>Impact of Atomic Number on Behavior:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>Lower Atomic Number Actinoids (e.g., Thorium, Protactinium): These elements are more stable and consume oxygen slowly. They require larger quantities to be effective in reactions but last much longer before breaking down. Their reactions are more gradual, leading to prolonged energy release and a delayed breakdown.</p>
                        <p>Higher Atomic Number Actinoids (e.g., Uranium, Plutonium): These elements are more unstable and consume oxygen rapidly, reaching their critical point much faster. They are most effective in smaller quantities and result in shorter-lived, explosive reactions. Their instability leads to violent explosions and rapid breakdowns when they run out of oxygen.</p>
                    </section>
                    <p>Practical Reactions and Applications:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>Lower Atomic Number Actinoids:</p>
                        <section>
                            <p>Ideal for controlled energy release over extended periods, where a gradual buildup and delayed reaction are desired.</p>
                            <p>Can be used in systems requiring long-term stability and gradual breakdown, such as energy storage systems or situations where reactions need to be sustained for longer durations.</p>
                        </section>
                        <p>Higher Atomic Number Actinoids:</p>
                        <section>
                            <p>Perfect for applications requiring rapid energy release or instantaneous reactions, such as high-powered reactors, weapons, or environments where explosions or fast breakdowns are beneficial.</p>
                            <p>Their violent explosions and short-lived reactions make them ideal for high-energy applications but require careful handling to prevent premature breakdown.</p>

                    </section>
                    <p>Specific Reaction to Water (H2O):</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>The Actinoid is capable of pulling the Oxygen particles from H2O when submerged in water. This will leave pure hydrogen behind and when (it will) the Hydrogen comes into contact with the supercooled Oxygen from the Actinoid the Hydrogen will explode violently.</p>
                        <p>The Hydrogen explosion will place additional pressure on the Actinoid, though the Oxygen particles will soften the explosion on the Actinoid and apply the pressure in such a way that the Actinoid compresses to pull in Oxygen particles even faster.</p>
                        <p>Once the Actinoid has exhausted the available oxygen, it falls apart due to its instability and is left vulnerable to violent explosions when the pure hydrogen (from H2O) or any oxygen present interacts with the Actinoid.</p>
                        <p>By this point much of the water left will have become Hydrogen gas and explode, leaving little to no water left depending on the size of the body of water.</p>
                    </section>
                    <p>Summary of Actinoid Properties:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>Triggering Event: Actinoids react to kinetic force, with the amount of force required inversely related to their atomic number (i.e., higher atomic numbers require less force to trigger a reaction).</p>
                        <p>Oxygen Consumption: Upon destabilization, Actinoids begin to consume oxygen particles and drain them of their heat and energy to maintain their structure temporarily resulting in the Oxygen particle being supercooled. This absorption leads to a struggle for balance, as their structure inevitably deteriorates.</p>
                        <p>Variation Based on Atomic Number:</p>
                        <section>
                            <p>Lower Atomic Number Actinoids consume oxygen slowly and are stable for longer periods, making them suitable for long-term reactions.</p>
                            <p>Higher Atomic Number Actinoids consume oxygen rapidly and break down faster, making them ideal for quick, explosive reactions but require smaller quantities to avoid premature failure.</p>

                <p>Supercooling a Nonmetal causes it to undergo a chemical reaction that changes its relationship with Fluxon significantly. Once Supercooled, that nonmetal will be unable to undergo any physical state change.</p>
                <p>Supercooling-Induced "Metallic" Magnetization in Nonmetals</p>
                <section>
                    <p>Chemical Change and Irreversibility:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>When a nonmetal is supercooled in your reality, it undergoes a frostbite-like threshold that freezes its atomic and molecular bonds into a new configuration.</p>
                        <p>This irreversible "freezing" causes the atoms to lock into place with a less tightly woven structure, distinct from their usual covalent or molecular bonding.</p>
                    </section>
                    <p>Loosening Bonds:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>The supercooling reduces the vibrational energy of the nonmetal's atomic lattice to near-zero. This allows for a partial delocalization of its outer electrons, similar to the electron "sea" in metallic bonding, but less free-flowing.</p>
                        <p>The loosened bonds don't entirely fall apart (preserving structural integrity) but create pockets of semi-free electrons that enable unique electromagnetic interactions.</p>
                    </section>
                    <p>Fluxon Magnetization:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>In this altered state, the material interacts with Fluxons by aligning its electronic domains to respond to their presence. While not identical to ferromagnetism (which involves the alignment of unpaired electron spins), this process creates a form of pseudo-magnetism where:</p>
                        <section>
                            <p>The supercooled material becomes a conductor for Fluxons, guiding their motion like a rail.</p>
                            <p>It exhibits selective attraction to other nonmetals and fluxon-sensitive materials, mimicking magnet-like behavior.</p>
                        </section>
                    </section>
                    <p>Comparison with Ferromagnetism:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>Unlike ferromagnetic materials like iron, the supercooled nonmetals don't depend on traditional exchange interactions (the quantum phenomenon aligning spins in ferromagnets).</p>
                        <p>Instead, the pseudo-magnetic effect arises from the static alignment of their atomic bonds and the interactions with Fluxons, whose spiral motion and energy influence the electron cloud alignment.</p>
                    </section>
                    <p>Unique Properties:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>This "magnetization" is specific to Fluxons and other nonmetals, meaning these materials can interact with Fluxon flows in ways ferromagnetic materials cannot.</p>
                        <p>Their magnetic qualities may weaken in environments that disrupt their frozen bond structure or deplete Fluxons.</p>
                    </section>
                    <p>The Following Effects:</p>
                    <section>
                        <p>A Solid will become “metallic” and while it won't be viable for direct weaponry as iron is with a sword it does gain a much higher resistance to kinetic energy change; it also becomes a conductor for Fluxons. To be a conductor for Fluxon allows it to carry Fluxons from a source to something else to then allow that something else a constant supply of Fluxons and therefore allowing it to hold an uninterrupted reaction in whatever way it would in our Reality.</p>
                        <p>A Liquid will become “Nonmetal magnetic” in that it will become attracted to any and all nearby nonmetals. It will also retain some conductivity for Fluxons, but not as much of that of a Supercooled Nonmetal Solid due to a Liquids lack of structure.</p>
                        <p>A Gas will become “Nonmetal magnetic” in that it will become attracted to any and all nearby nonmetals. It often becomes unviable for breathing or straight up harmful depending on its properties before supercooling, this allows it to last indefinitely as long as no outside force eliminates it in particular. The main change in this is that the Gas becomes bonded with faded Fluxons and allows them to work on any other Nonmetal allowing any Nonmetal in contact with the Gas to hold a reaction without any apparent source for Fluxons.</p>

                    <p>Stable Isotope: 1</p>

                    <p>Reaction Post-Activation:</p>
                    <p>After a Fluxon particle is applied following sufficient heat to exceed the melting point, hydrogen, being a gas at room temperature, wouldn't typically form a liquid under normal atmospheric pressure without significant compression. However, in this alternate reality, hydrogen might form a liquid-like gel when heated and activated by a Fluxon particle, likely due to the unique activation process. The gas would become denser and behave more like a viscous liquid than a normal gaseous state.</p>

                    <h1>2. Helium</h1>
                     <p>Stable Isotopes: 3, 4</p>
                     <p>Stable Range of Masses: 4 (Note: Helium-3 is rare, but stable)</p>
                     <p>Melting Point: -272.2°C</p>
                     <p>Boiling Point: -268.93°C</p>
                     <p>Reaction Post-Activation:</p>
                     <p>Helium, which is typically a gas under normal conditions, would remain in a gas state even at lower temperatures unless it is at extremely low pressures. However, once it reaches the required temperature and a Fluxon particle is applied, its behavior would be dramatically different in this reality, possibly transitioning into a non-standard gel or liquid state due to the high vibration of atoms that a Fluxon particle triggers, though it might not react strongly enough to solidify.</p>

                    <h1>3. Lithium</h1>

                     <p>Reaction Post-Activation:</p>
                     <p>At higher temperatures, lithium typically reacts with oxygen and water, producing heat and hydrogen gas. With a Fluxon particle applied, lithium's reactivity may increase, possibly leading it to melt and become a gelatinous substance before it reacts with water or oxygen. The material might be much more fluid than in standard conditions, with the reaction being intensified once activated. This behavior would be similar to an accelerated "melting" into a viscous, reactive state, but only after reaching the necessary heat and activation threshold.</p>

                     <p>Stable Range of Masses: 9</p>
                     <p>Melting Point: 1287°C</p>
                     <p>Boiling Point: 2471°C</p>
                     <p>Reaction Post-Activation:</p>
                     <p>Beryllium is highly reactive, especially with halogens and acids. Once it is heated and a Fluxon particle is applied, it would still melt at its high temperature threshold, becoming more fluid. Its reactivity might cause it to bond with gases in the air or materials around it, forming solid compounds, but the primary change would likely be its transition into a molten, metallic form due to the heat before reacting further.</p>

                     <p>Stable Range of Masses: 10, 11</p>

                     <p>Reaction Post-Activation:</p>
                     <p>Boron would require very high temperatures to melt or undergo chemical reactions. After sufficient heat and a Fluxon particle activation, it might behave similarly to carbon, melting into a more fluid or semi-liquid form, potentially reacting with oxygen to form boron oxide. However, the melting would likely be more controlled and less explosive compared to other reactive metals.</p>

                     <p>Stable Range of Masses: 12, 13</p>
                     <p>Melting Point: Sublimation point at 3915°C (directly goes from solid to gas)</p>
                     <p>Boiling Point: N/A</p>
                     <p>Reaction Post-Activation:</p>
                     <p>Upon reaching the necessary heat, carbon would likely melt into a gelatinous or semi-liquid substance upon activation with a Fluxon particle. Unlike in normal conditions, where it would sublimate, the activation by a Fluxon particle would loosen its atomic structure, enabling it to form a gel-like liquid instead of turning directly into gas. This would allow carbon to exhibit different properties in this reality, akin to melting.</p>

                     <p>Reaction Post-Activation:</p>
                     <p>Nitrogen, being a gas at room temperature, would remain gaseous unless compressed, but under a Fluxon particle activation and high temperature, it would condense into a liquid nitrogen-like substance. Its molecules might remain tightly bonded, and the typical behavior of it forming gaseous clouds upon interaction with room temperature objects would shift toward a more stable, condensed state once it is activated and heated sufficiently.</p>

                     <p>Stable Range of Masses: 16, 17, 18</p>

                     <p>Reaction Post-Activation:</p>
                     <p>Oxygen, once activated by a Fluxon particle and brought to a sufficiently high temperature, would condense into a liquid.

                    <p>Gallium is unique in that it has a low melting point and is a soft, silvery metal. Upon activation with a Fluxon particle, it would melt almost immediately even at room temperature and form a viscous, slightly gelatinous liquid. Gallium is highly reactive with aluminum, which causes the aluminum to degrade rapidly. If in contact with aluminum, the a Fluxon particle activation could facilitate the reaction, leading to the degradation of the aluminum by the formation of gallium-aluminum alloys.</p>

                    <p>Reaction Post-Activation:</p>
                    <p>Oganesson is a synthetic element and the heaviest noble gas known, but it is predicted to behave like a solid at room temperature under certain conditions. Under activation with a Fluxon particle, if it were to remain in a solid state (predicted to melt at around 50°C), it would act similarly to other noble gasses. The activation would cause it to melt into a liquid, but its tendency to act like a noble gas suggests limited reactivity with oxygen or acids. However, if it interacts with other elements, there could be potential for a slow reaction at high temperatures, possibly forming oganesson oxide (OgO). The molten oganesson might remain inert, with oxidation not progressing significantly.</p>
