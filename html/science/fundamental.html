        <h1>Fundamental Science</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Most of the differing science from our understanding occurs from the fact that while electrons are able to receive and release energy as normal it is unable to actually change the overall atomic structure until it is exposed to the particle known as Fluxon's. These electrons are otherwise locked in place despite increasing or decreasing in energy until a Fluxon particle is applied.</p>
            <p>Other additional changes in science are by direct decision from Reality. These changes do not require the Fluxon interaction to take place since they were specifically altered by Reality.</p>
            <p>Fluxon's are a quantum particle produced indefinitely by Lifeforce. </p>
            <p>Lifeforce is made up of an individual's Soul (a cosmic identifier) and Life Energy (overall connection to “Magic” forces/energies). </p>
            <p>A Fluxon particle is ejected from the Lifeforce at the speed of an electron (2.2 x 10^6 m/s) in a spiraling pattern with an angle of 0 that increases exponentially toward 90 degrees. The speed also increases at an exponential rate as the particle remains within the cylindrical pathing creating faster and faster speeds due centripetal motion. By the time the Fluxon reaches the electron it has an angle of 90 degrees and orbits the electron until its speed has reached just above the speed of light, in which it will then split with the energy continuing the speed and leaving this reality and the physical particle left behind as a faded Fluxon. For all tense and purposes the ascended Fluxon particle will have disappeared at the speed of light and it was from our perspective the hypothetical continuation of that speed causing it to go beyond light and therefore transcending this physical plane, while leaving behind a faded Fluxon particle as a physical remnant that remains relatively inert and motionless.</p>

        <h2>Quantum Coding</h2>
        <section>
            <p>The determination of what works and what doesn't comes down to the Quantum Coding within the smallest building blocks that are in use. For Electrons, they fluctuate between a number of quantum states in a Schroedinger-like fashion, determining whichever state is chosen depends on which Reality they are located in. If there are three Realities that border each other then an electron in any of these Realities will calculate between 3 quantum states and will decide the outcome to the Reality that it exists in. </p>
            <p>The pattern here is irrelevant when you pull it into question except to explain the phenomenon with Dragons. The existence of Dragons introduces what is known as Quantumly Dominant DNA (QD-DNA). This means that when something with QD-DNA enters a Reality outside of their own, instead of the particles they are made up of suddenly obeying the rules of this new Reality, they will continue to obey their own rules of Reality, This also applies to objects they are in contact with. So if someone with QD-DNA from our Reality went to the ORC Reality with a gun, then that gun would continue to work as long as they are in contact with that gun. But if they aren't touching the gun then it would abide by the rules of the ORC Reality, so that person would be the only one capable of operating the gun (The specifics is that gunpowder won't ignite under the rules of the ORC Reality).</p>
            <p>Faded Fluxons serve primarily one purpose within their quantum coding. If any electrons were to suddenly occupy its 3D space in an unnatural way such as with portals or whatnot, then the particle will momentarily jump back to life and will activate any electrons that suddenly appeared.</p>
            <p>Once the Fluxon has faded, the Electron returns to being locked in whatever state it was left.</p>
