        <h1>Classes</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Barbarian: Barbarians harness their inner power, channeling primal rage and strength to become formidable warriors. They can tap into this raw energy for extended periods, making them capable of taking on entire armies.</p>
            <p>Bard: Bards use music to communicate with various sources, be it Reality or Deities, to create magic or persuade others through their inner power. Their abilities to play for extended periods are enhanced by drawing upon their inner power.</p>
            <p>Cleric: Clerics form very surface level pacts with Deities to bolster a specific trait of theirs.</p>
            <p>Druid: Druids commune with nature and primal forces, replicating or manipulating them through their inner power.</p>
            <p>Fighter: Fighters tap into their inner power to enhance their senses and react swiftly in combat, effectively taking on multiple opponents at once.</p>
            <p>Monk: Monks focus on refining their inner power to fight with precision and skill, sometimes using their abilities to temporarily disrupt their opponents' inner power.</p>
            <p>Paladin: Paladins, unlike Warlocks, swear oaths to serve Deities, granting them substantial power as long as they remain faithful to their oath.</p>
            <p>Ranger: Rangers are skilled hunters capable of surviving and thriving in the wilderness for extended periods.</p>
            <p>Rogue: Rogues rely on stealth and their ability to lower their presence, drawing upon their inner power to go unnoticed in various situations.</p>
            <p>Sorcerer: Sorcerers draw power from objects or their ancestral bloodline, in which case, they would be drawing power from the very blood that courses through their veins.</p>
            <p>Warlock: Warlocks gain power from Deities, making deals or forming pacts, and have greater freedom than Paladins in their choices. But this oftentimes opens themselves up to getting messed with by undefined Deities. </p>
            <p>Wizard: Wizards communicate with Reality to shape magic, but their spells require precise articulation, and they often become scholars due to the complexity of their art. Wizardry at its absolute peak becomes a programmer manipulating code to get it to do what they want, the code being the fabric of reality. This is dangerous both in practice due to the specificity and raw energy, and the attention it can draw from deities.</p>
