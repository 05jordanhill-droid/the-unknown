        <h1>Genetic Gems</h1>
        <section>
            <p>On a rare occasion that someone is born with an extremely potent Deity connection, they are born with a specific ability. Sometimes these abilities are related to their Deity parent, sometimes the ability is seemingly random. These abilities are made manifest through Genetic Gems the person is born with which is embedded in them. These Gems are actual Gems and can be anywhere as small as a speck of dust to as big as more than the person themself. Individuals born with such a Gem are called Nobles. The Gem itself carries the ability and it retains much power if it is removed from the individual, but the individual must die for the Gem to be removed, otherwise the Gem will be incapable of being removed. And as long as the individual is alive they have power from the Gem even if the body part the Gem is embedded in is cut off.</p>
            <p>Someone who obtains such a Gem often binds it to a weapon or armor, because physical contact to the Gem by anyone other than the one born with it is brought great pain.</p>
            <p>On rare occasions the Gem will accept a new host and will attach itself to them as it did with the one born with the Gem.</p>
