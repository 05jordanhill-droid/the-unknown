        <h1>Rules of Reality</h1>
        <section>
            <h3>1. Absolute Position (Location in Space)</h3>
            <section>
                <p>Default Equation: X1,Y1,Z1 = X1,Y1,Z1</p>
                <p>This represents the location of an object (or person) in three-dimensional space. The equation simply states that the object is at a certain position (X1,Y1,Z1), and that's its default, unaltered position.</p>
                <p>Manipulation can then shift it to a new set of coordinates, representing a portal:</p>
                <p>X1,Y1,Z1 = X2,Y2,Z2</p>
                <p>Where X2,Y2,Z2 is the target position in space, effectively creating a portal between the two locations.</p>
            </section>
            <h3>2. Relative Movement (Changes in Position or Velocity)</h3>
            <section>
                <p>Default Equation: ΔX1,ΔY1,ΔZ1 = ΔX1,ΔY1,ΔZ1</p>
                <p>This represents normal movement; the changes ΔX,ΔY,ΔZ are exactly as given, meaning the object is moving normal.</p>
                <p>Manipulating the speed or acceleration can adjust these values:</p>
                <p>ΔX1,ΔY1,ΔZ1 = ΔX2,ΔY2,ΔZ2</p>
                <p>This represents a change in velocity or acceleration between the initial and final states outside of the external force causing the initial normal change, such as the speed manipulation of an object or being.</p>
            </section>
            <h3>3. Thought Frequency (Mental or Cognitive State)</h3>
            <section>
                <p>Default Equation: PΨ(A,t1) → PΨ(A,t2)</p>
                <p>This represents the cognitive state of an individual (A) moving from one point in time to another. It's simply the progression of the individual's thoughts over time (t1 to t2).</p>
                <p>Manipulation could adjust this by altering the connection to another being's thoughts, effectively creating a mind link:</p>
                <p>PΨentry(A,t1) → PΨentry(B,t2)</p>
                <p>This establishes a thought connection between A and B, allowing A's thoughts to exist in B's mind.</p>
            </section>
            <h3>4. Gravity (Local Gravitational Forces)</h3>
            <section>
                <p>Default Equation: G(A) = 64 → MT</p>
                <p>Gravity in your world isn't a simple force that pulls everything toward the ground. Instead, it's a connection determined by individual timelines. In its default state, every being has their own personalized gravity constant that determines their relationship to the ground, space, and reality.</p>
                <p>A general form might be represented as a constant (g1) where the individual's timeline controls the gravitational effect, i.e., how they interact with space-time.</p>
                <p>Manipulating this constant could cause changes like defying gravity or altering gravity's direction or strength. The equation for change could look like:</p>
                <p>G(A) = (64±n) → MT</p>
            </section>
            <h3>5. Time (Temporal Flow or Distortion)</h3>
            <section>
                <p>Default Equation: T(A) = 1</p>
                <p>Time itself could have a simple baseline where the temporal flow is linear and consistent for a given object or person, represented by t1.</p>
                <p>Manipulating time could allow for things like slowing time for a subject, rewinding events, or creating a time loop. This manipulation might look like:</p>
                <p>T(A) = 2 (doubling the progression of their time)</p>
                <p>This would represent a time manipulation spell that affects the subject's experience or progression through time.</p>
            </section>
            <h3>6. Space (Relative Positioning in a Multidimensional Space)</h3>
            <section>
                <p>Default Equation: Relative Position(X1,Y1,Z1) → Target Position(X1,Y1,Z1)</p>
                <p>The default for space in your system is based on a fixed coordinate in the space-time continuum. The object is in one particular spot.</p>
                <p>Manipulating this relative space, as we've discussed, could involve moving through different dimensions or layers. For example:</p>
                <p>Relative Position(X1,Y1,Z1) → Target Position(X2,Y2,Z2)</p>
                <p>Here you're changing the position of the object, potentially transporting them across vast distances or between different realities.</p>
