        <h1>Energies/Crystals</h1>
        <p>Energies are naturally invisible to the naked eye. Crystals form like water forming in fog or sugar crystals forming in sugar water to a stick.</p>
        <section>
            <p>Life Crystal: Amplifies the presence of a soul (plant life holds a soul as well). </p>
            <p>Void Crystal: Amplifies the absence of Realities authority, these form on the outer layer of Reality within Existence and is only accessible by Deities. Void energy is found in Existence. Use on self allows you to see through the eyes of another as your consciousness is transcending time and space. Use on self causes an immediate consequence of dissociation and loss of self as you become addicted to it just to keep yourself lucid.</p>
            <p>Red Crystals (Strength): Amplifies the physical power but causes overexertion, muscle deterioration, or violent outbursts with overuse. The energy appears around the anger of a powerful being and if intense enough will form the crystal.</p>
            <p>Blue Crystals (Wisdom): Enhance magical or intellectual abilities but lead to obsession, mental instability, or as the stopping the use of, memory loss. The energy forms in the minds of Psions, Mystics, and similar occurring Meta's, condensing this energy forms the crystal.</p>
            <p>Green Crystals (Healing): Accelerate physical recovery but reduce the body's ability to heal naturally. When the head of a hydra is cut off it emits this energy and can form the crystal for particularly massive wounds.</p>
            <p>White Crystals (Clarity): Enhance focus and perception but may cause paranoia or an inability to switch off heightened awareness. The energy exudes from the presence of the Deity of Truth and her touching anything causing the crystals to form.</p>
