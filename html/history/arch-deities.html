        <h1>Arch-Deities</h1>
        <p>An Arch-Deity is the most powerful form of a Deity. This entity is not achieved via a single Deities achievement or power. An Arch-Deity happens when the regular formation of a Deity is manipulated to form effectively as opposed to the Deity forming naturally and ineffectively. This allows the Deity to reach a level of power it would not be able to achieve naturally. There are only 3 known Arch-Dieties in existence as follows: The Seer, The Hunter, and The Judge (AKA Truth, Time, and Death). These 3 are known as the Council of Deity.</p>
        <h2>The Council of Deities</h2>
        <section>
            <p>The dynamics you've crafted among the Arch-deities—Death, Time, and Truth—are intriguing and offer a rich foundation for your narrative. Here's a deeper exploration of their roles, perceptions, and interactions, incorporating the elements you've provided:</p>
            <section>
                <h3>Time (The Hunter)</h3>
                <h3>Nature & Presence</h3>
                <p>-Unstoppable Force: Time is seen as an unstoppable and relentless entity, akin to Batman's persona of a calculated, unyielding force. His progression is inevitable, and he pursues his targets with an almost predatory focus.</p>
                <p>-Manipulation & Control: Time can freeze, rewind, or accelerate an individual's timeline to ensure stability. This manipulation is subtle but profoundly impactful, often leaving mortals unaware of the full extent of his interference.</p>
                <h4>Perception</h4>
                <p>-Feared: Mortals and lesser deities view Time with trepidation. His ability to alter timelines and his relentless pursuit make him a figure of dread and respect.</p>
                <p>-Symbolism: Time's presence might be symbolized by an intricate, ever-ticking clock or a shadowy figure with eyes that pierce through the fabric of reality.</p>
                
                <h3>Truth (The Seer)</h3>
                <h3>Nature & Presence</h3>
                <p>-Revered Entity: Truth is regarded as a sacred and elusive force. Though she embodies the concept of Truth, her direct interaction with mortals is rare, making her a figure of awe rather than personal connection.</p>
                <p>-Abstract & Defined: While Truth is a defined being with a clear essence, her manifestations are often abstract, leading many to perceive her as a force rather than a person. Oracles and seers strive to glimpse her essence, but her true nature remains obscured.</p>
                <h4>Perception</h4>
                <p>-Revered but Unseen: Mortals and even other deities revere Truth, but her lack of direct communication means she is often viewed through a veil of mystery. Her interactions are indirect, often coming through cryptic visions or profound realizations.</p>
                <p>-Symbolism: Truth's representation could include symbols like an all-seeing eye, an intricate web of light, or a labyrinthine pattern that suggests depth and complexity.</p>

                <h3>Death (The Judge)</h3>
                <h3>Nature & Presence</h3>
                <p>-Unknown Power: Death is the most enigmatic of the Arch-deities, with his true nature and motives shrouded in mystery. Unlike Time and Truth, Death's interactions are infrequent but significant, often marked by a deep sense of gravity.</p>
                <p>-Judgment & Balance: Death presides over the end of life and the resolution of immortality. His decisions are impartial and balanced, reflecting an ancient and formidable power comparable to Kronos among the Olympian gods.</p>
                <h4>Perception</h4>
                <p>-Unknown & Mysterious: Mortals and deities alike know little about Death. His power and influence are felt rather than understood, and his decisions carry immense weight.</p>
                <p>-Symbolism: Death might be represented by symbols of finality and balance, such as a set of scales, a gavel, or a cloak of shadows that obscures his form.</p>
                
                <h3>The Arch-deities' Relationship with Other Deities</h3>
                <p>-Hierarchy & Influence: The Arch-deities—Death, Time, and Truth—form a trinity of order and structure, viewed as paramount figures compared to the other deities who emerged later and represent more diverse aspects of existence.</p>
                <p>-Interplay: The dynamic between the Arch-deities reflects a balance of power and purpose. Time's relentless pursuit maintains the flow of existence, Truth's revelations guide understanding, and Death's judgments ensure balance and resolution. Their combined presence shapes the very fabric of the universe.</p>
                
                <h3>Interactions Among the Arch-deities</h3>
                <p>-Time and Truth: Time might seek insights from Truth or align his actions with her revelations to ensure that the timelines he manages are in harmony with universal truths. Their relationship is one of mutual respect, with Time's actions often guided by the truths unveiled by The Seer.</p>
                <p>-Time and Death: Death's role in managing the end of life intersects with Time's manipulation of timelines. They may work in tandem when resolving conflicts or anomalies that involve significant transitions or powerful entities.</p>
                <p>-Truth and Death: Truth's insights into the nature of existence and the truth of mortality can influence Death's judgments. While Truth provides the broader understanding of existence, Death enforces the finality of life with an impartial hand.</p>

                <h3>The Formation of Deities</h3>
                <h3>Arch-deities as Foundational Figures</h3>
                <p>-The Arch-deities are seen as the fundamental cornerstones upon which the pantheon was built. They embody essential principles that shaped the emergence of subsequent deities, creating a pattern of order and consciousness.</p>
                <p>-Minor Deities' Evolution: The lesser deities and their domains evolved from the structure established by the Arch-deities. These deities reflect the complexities and nuances that arose from the foundational order set by Death, Time, and Truth.</p>
