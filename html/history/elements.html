                Elementals are defined as the living embodiment of an Element from the periodic table of elements. A Pure Elemental will embodiment only the one Element, but most Elementals are a mixture. This allows for Elementals of Water, Fire, Lava, etc… There are also Lightning Elementals thanks to Electrons being able to participate in becoming part of an Elemental.

                Elementals are to put simply humanoid creatures of the Elements. They were created by Reality as a countermeasure to Dragon because while a Dragon may be unaffected by any and all temperature or Element-specific effects due to their immunity to the laws of all (from their view) foreign Realities, an Elemental that controls solid material can easily construct physical restrainments on the Dragon.

            <h2>E-Waves</h2>
            <p>Elementals are capable of producing a frequency wave called E-Waves (Elemental-Waves) similar to how we produce sound waves.</p>
            <h3>Wave Breakdown:</h3>
            <h4>1. Waves 1-3 (Core Element Waves)</h4>
            <section>
                <p><b>Properties:</b> These waves carry the core (dominant) element particles that make up the elemental's physical form, such as oxygen, hydrogen, iron or other base elements from the periodic table.</p>
                <p><b>Amplitude:</b> The Amplitudes of Waves 1-7 are all equal allowing Wave 8 to drown it out in most cases.</p>
                <p><b>Frequency:</b> These waves have the highest frequency and therefore fastest oscillation out of the 9 Waves. But their effects are contained within the elemental's domain, offering control over elemental behavior. Waves 1-2 specifically require coordination to prevent them canceling each other out.</p>
                <p><b>Function:</b> These waves focus on manipulating the element’s pure properties, affecting surrounding materials or objects and transforming them according to the elemental's will. Wave 3, being particularly dense, carries not only the core particle but also a signal that communicates with Post-Transition Clay-Metals and other materials akin to their own element.</p>
            </section>
            <h4>2. Waves 4-5 (Elemental Mixture Waves)</h4>
            <section>
                <p>Properties: These waves carry mixtures of element particles that fit the elemental's theme, and are less pure compared to Waves 1-3. These particles could form combinations of the elemental's core with auxiliary materials, such as fire and metal or air and dust.</p>
                <p>Amplitude: The Amplitudes of Waves 1-7 are all equal allowing Wave 8 to drown it out in most cases.</p>
                <p>Frequency: They hold a Frequency less than 1-3, meaning slower than Waves 1-3 but still powerful. These waves allow for greater range but require coordination to avoid canceling each other out.</p>
                <p>Function: Waves 4-5 have a similar effect as 1-3 except they are capable of carrying a variety of particles that surround the Elementals general theme allowing for a wide variety of effects.</p>
            </section>
            <h4>3. Waves 6-7 (Sound and Communication Waves)</h4>
            <section>
                <p>Properties: These waves carry additional sound waves, and are the primary communication channels for elementals to interact with others of their kind.</p>
                <p>Amplitude: The Amplitudes of Waves 1-7 are all equal allowing Wave 8 to drown it out in most cases.</p>
                <p>Frequency: They hold a Frequency less than 1-5, meaning slower than Waves 1-5 but still powerful. These waves allow for greater range but require coordination to avoid canceling each other out.</p>
                <p>Function: Wave 6 carries signals that are specifically detectable only by elementals of the same type as the sender, while Wave 7 can be perceived by all elementals. Together, these waves can be aligned to send a message to any Elemental or they can be offset to send a message only to Elementals of the same kind</p>
                <p>Canceling Property: Normally, Wave 6 and Wave 7 cancel each other out, but a skilled elemental can manipulate them to align for communication or offset them for private messages.</p>
            </section>
            <h4>4. Wave 8 (Wave of Obstruction)</h4>
            <section>
                <p>Properties: This is a 2D wave that takes up a spiraling, sweeping shape in the 3D plane. It serves as a barrier for the manipulation of Waves 1-7.</p>
                <p>Amplitude: The Amplitude of Wave 8 is greater than 1-7 at any given moment to allow 8 to envelop and drown out 1-7.</p>
                <p>Frequency: The Frequency is lower than 1-7 creating a slower wave, with a sweeping, spiral-like movement that moves through the environment.</p>
                <p>Function: Wave 8's primary role is to obstruct or block Waves 1-7 from interacting freely with the environment unless the wave's frequency is slowed down. By controlling the oscillation of Wave 8, an elemental can allow Waves 1-7 to become detectable. </p>
            </section>
            <h4>5. Wave 9 (The Sound Carrier)</h4>
            <section>
                <p>Properties: Wave 9 is the actual sound wave carried by the elemental, moving through the air or any medium in which it propagates. This wave is the output of the elemental's influence, and its interactions are more dynamic and can be felt by other beings.</p>
                <p>Amplitude: The Amplitude of Wave 9 is greater than 1-8 at any given moment.</p>
                <p>Frequency: The Frequency of Wave 9 is greater than 1-8 at any given moment.</p>
                <p>Function: Wave 9 is the final result of the E-Wave's energy, carrying the core message or signal produced by the elemental. While other waves provide the substance for the message, Wave 9 is what projects it into the physical world.</p>
            </section>
            <h3>Variations of Wave Properties (Interaction Between Waves)</h3>
            <h4>Wave Interactions:</h4>
            <section>
                <p>1-2 Canceling: Waves 1 and 2 can cancel each other out. As these waves carry core elemental particles, if their frequencies and amplitudes conflict, they can neutralize each other's effects. This occurs by default.</p>
                <p>4-5 Canceling: Waves 4 and 5 also have a similar function, which allows them to cancel each other out under certain conditions. This occurs by default.</p>
                <p>6-7 Interaction: Waves 6 and 7 can either align to form a collective message to any elementals or offset each other to transmit individual messages between elementals of the same type.</p>
                <p>Wave 8's Obstruction: The slower the oscillation of Wave 8, the more detectable Waves 1-7 become. Wave 8, therefore, provides a shield or filter for Wave 1-7 manipulation, allowing control over the environment and limiting the visibility of certain signals.</p>
                <p>Wave 9 Free Communication: Wave 9 can carry sound waves to carry a message to any entity.</p>
            </section>
            <h3>E-Wave in Practice (Real-World Application of Wave Properties)</h3>
            <p>The E-Wave has both intricate manipulative and reactive functions. Here are a few practical applications based on the interaction of these waves:</p>
            <section>
                <h4>Environmental Manipulation:</h4>
                <p>By adjusting the frequency and amplitude of Waves 1–5, an elemental can reshape the terrain. For example, manipulating the Frequencies of Waves 1–5 could allow an elemental to manipulate earth to form structures or create firestorms. Waves 1-3 use only the core (or dominant) element of the Elemental, while Waves 4-5 use a variety of particles that surround the general theme of the Elemental.</p>
                <h4>Communication:</h4>
                <p>Skilled elementals can use Waves 6–7 to communicate privately or to broadcast signals to other elementals. For example, if an elemental wants to send a message to another of the same type, they can manipulate Wave 6 to send a specific signal, which might be undetectable by any other elemental. Or they could achieve a similar result of communicating privately with only Elementals no matter the type by aligning Waves 6-7.</p>
                <h4>Commanding Post-Transition Clay-Metal (PTCM):</h4>
                <p>With enough skill over Wave 3, an elemental can command PTCMs (No matter the type of the Elemental) to form complex tools or structures. For example, a skilled elemental could cause PTCMs to move autonomously, forming defensive structures or even sentient-like behavior by using the signals from Wave 3.</p>
                <p>Wave 3 can achieve the same effect with other materials but only if the material is the same as the Elementals core element.</p>
