            <p>Dragons predate Reality itself. They swim through Reality remaining unaffected by the forces of Reality. The most ancient and powerful Dragons are actually capable of traversing Existences. Dragons come in all sizes and intellect, some are fully sentient and intelligent while others are closer to wild beasts. Different Dragons have different abilities that make them special. Many ancient Dragons had the ability to shapeshift and gave birth to many half Dragon children with many different species. These offspring are called Draglings. A Dragon and an Elf would make an Elf Dragling. But the offspring of a Dragling and another Dragling results in a Dragonborn, Human-Like Dragon. This is because of the dominant gene that Dragons carry.</p>
            <p>Dragons are the ones who carried knowledge of the Infinite Reality to the Omniverse Existence, creating myths.</p>
