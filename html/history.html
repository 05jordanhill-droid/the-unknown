                <h1>Timeline of History</h1>
            </section>
            <div class="beginning">
                <p>In the beginning of life in Reality, Reality formed the elements and the elementals thereof. </p>
                <p>The Ancient Dragons brought a colony of medieval-time humans from England in the Quilted Multiverse Reality. </p>
                <h4><a href="history/dragons.html">Dragons</a></h4>
                <p>Order and Chaos formed Elves after the likeness of Humans with varying differences to make them better in many ways. </p>
                <p>The original colony of Humans constructed the Citadel which produces rays of light going across the land creating the cycle of day and night outside of the Citadel. The Citadel stands tall throughout all Ages because it is led by Ancient Dragons in the form of a Human.</p>
                <p>Reality uses a Representative to carry out its wishes since Reality is not conscious enough to make itself a physical form.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="chaos">
                <p>The Elves split into two groups. One pledged to Order, the other to Chaos. The ones of Chaos pledged to kill the physical body of Order. As a result those Elves were granted many abilities turning into Drows. Some of these Drows took it further and began slaughtering Elves of Order using their new found abilities. This brought in an age of great Chaos.</p>
                <p>During this Age of Chaos, Drows, acting in the name of Chaos, granted life to many things, including trees (Ents), etc…</p>
                <p>During this time, Humans had established great cities by studying the rules of Reality to loophole the rules into their way to power. Many of these Humans captured Volcanic elementals and used them to power great machines. This greatly angered Reality and Reality cursed those Humans to become Tieflings. The Tieflings became outcasts to all societies. </p>
                <h4><a href="history/elements.html">Elementals</a></h4>
                <p>Those Humans who freed the Elementals from captivity were blessed by Reality with great strength, willpower, and stature as Giants. Those Humans who were able but didn't free Elementals were stunted in strength, growth, and willpower as Halflings.</p>
                <p>Ancient Dragons further interacted with Reality and had children being both classic Dragons and Dragonborns among all species. </p>
                <p>As Order slowly came back into consciousness it weakened the wall of Existence ever so slightly to allow (rarely) slivers of Imagination in to form Deities. Order took the leaked Imagination and sped up its formation into 3 Arch-deities: Death, Truth, and Time. </p>
                <h4><a href="history/arch-deities.html">Arch-Deities</a></h4>
                <p>The Deity of Time created the passage of time to bring a natural end to the lives of all mortals over time.</p>
                <p>The Deity of Death created a powerful dimension to capture the souls of the dead to prevent them from messing with Reality.</p>
                <p>The Deity of Truth made all things known to that Deity to prevent any Cosmic extinctions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="order">
                <p>When Order came into full consciousness and was once again found in Reality with a physical form, the descendants of those Drows who had killed Order's previous form were cursed as Goblins.</p>
                <p>Goblins and Giants made Orcs.</p>
                <p>Humans and a variety of species made many half species.</p>
                <p>Giants and Halflings made Dwarves.</p>
                <p>Elves and Halflings made Gnomes.</p>
                <p>Giants and Ents made Treekin.</p>
                <p>Treekin and Elves made Dryads.</p>
                <p>Water Elementals and Elves made Naiads.</p>
                <p>Humans created the Warforges.</p>
                <p>Goblins and Dragons made Kobolds.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="war">
                <p>Elves and Giants made Blesseds.</p>
                <p>Drows and Tieflings made Curseds.</p>
                <p>Blesseds and Curseds became locked in a thousand year war that destroyed the land, creating much devastation. </p>
                <p>Reality, Chaos, and Order agreed to put a stop to the war. </p>
                <p>Curseds were turned into Gremlins. Blesseds were turned into Ogres. Gremlins are birthed from the back of Ogres like that one frog. Gremlins are like piranhas and will eat and eat. Gremlins will grow up and turn into Ogres.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="deities">
                <p>By this time, Imagination has leaked through Existence a lot and has created hundreds of minor Deities. These Deities have fully formed and have negotiated with Reality to be let in.</p>
                <p>Many of the Deities formed pacts with various species and grant “magic” to them according to the power of that deity. </p>
                <p>Reality copies the Deities and calls upon its Representative to reveal bits of the language in which Reality listens. This allows various magic users to communicate with Reality to cause different “magic” things to happen.</p>
                <p>The presence of Deities weakens the consciousness of Order and Chaos causing them to easily slip into Unconsciousness. This causes them to call on various species to act under an oath to them. Those who pledge allegiance to either one become their “Child”. (Child of Chaos, Child of Order)</p>
                <p>Deities have children with any species and the children are either half deity half whatever species (ex: Demi-Goblin, Demi-Gorgon, Demi-Human) or are an Aasimar. Aasimars are pledged at birth to serve their deity parentElement and they hold no innate abilities akin to their deity parentElement. Aasimars only draw physical features from their deity parentElement and none from their mortal parentElement. Aasimars are most prevalent among Humans due to their Dragon involvement and Demi-Human is incredibly rare.</p>
                <p>Children of Demi's are bloodline Sorcerers. The more pure the bloodline of magic there is the more potent magic that the Sorcerer can draw from their own blood.</p>
                <p>/The events of “Unknown Pasts” and “Unknown Futures” brings this Age to a close./</p>
            </div>
            <div class="titans">
                <p>/This Age comes to a close due to the unchecked disorder of the rise of Titans and the extinction of the majority of life./</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wasteland">
                <p>/This Age is the longest of all and only comes to an end when one man who had been cursed with immortality back in the Age of Deities becomes lucid once more (he was in and out starting from the middle of the Age of Titans). He cultivates new life./</p>
            </div>
            <div class="new">
                <p>/New life is restored, awaking the eye of Reality to work upon the land once more./</p>
