                    Mortals are categorized by the power one has over specific entities such as Deities. Mortals have a wide spectrum in terms of capability in ability and power, but despite this, no Mortal is capable of ever truly killing the consciousness of a Deity or any other nonMortal being, unless that Mortal becomes a Titan.

                <h3>The Celestial Embodiments</h3>
                <p>Hyper-Filtered Imagination: Deities are born when a stream of Imagination hyper-filters through the Walls of Existence, resulting in semi-conscious entities with a singular aspect that defines their nature.</p>
                <p>Awakening of Consciousness: Eventually, the Deity awakens in the Celestial Reality, gaining a level of consciousness akin to that of a virus. They become aware of their purpose, driven to fulfill the hyper-filtered aspect of Imagination from which they originated. This singular focus compels them to act upon their nature, much like a virus following its programmed instructions.</p>
                <p>Seeking Control: Initially, a newly awakened Deity lacks control over their actions and remains overshadowed by more established Deities within the Celestial Reality. They strive to gain a foothold and establish their identity in the intricate hierarchy of The ORC Existence.</p>
                <p>Manifestation in Reality: To influence the world of Reality, a Deity must confine its essence within a physical body. This connection with a physical form restricts their power, but it allows them to interact with the Kingdoms and entities of The Infinite Reality directly.</p>
                <p>Development of Persona: Over time, as a Deity resides within their chosen form, they develop a personality and individuality beyond the singular aspect of their existence. This persona influences their actions and decisions, shaping their interactions with mortals and other beings.</p>
                <p>Interaction with Mortals: Some Deities remain aloof and distant from mortal affairs, while others actively engage with the Kingdoms, granting power to Warlocks or answering the prayers of devout followers. Their interactions with mortals can be mysterious, awe-inspiring, or even terrifying, depending on the Deity's nature and temperament.</p>
                <p>The Secrets of The ORC Existence: Deities in The Infinite Reality hold knowledge and insights beyond mortal comprehension. Their experiences span eons, and they possess a profound understanding of the intricate fabric that weaves together the Reality in which they reside.</p>
                <p>Throughout this process, the Deities' journey remains veiled in mystery and wonder, and their influence on the Kingdoms and the lives of mortals is a fascinating tapestry woven into the grand design of The ORC Existence.</p>

            <h1>gods</h1>
            <section>
                <p>A god is defined as a being having power over Imagination. They are capable of organizing Imagination and can reside in unorganized Imagination without becoming undefined because they have already lived a mortal life and have been raised above the chaos of Imagination. </p>
                <p>gods are only ever spoken of briefly and are never fully understood or explained.</p>
