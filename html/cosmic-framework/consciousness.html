            <h3>Imagination</h3>
            <p>
                Outside of everything there resides unorganized Imagination without any kind of form. While there is no actual form to it, it is often imagined as static. This static quality of it would overcome any being, other than a god, and would consume them into the unorganization.
            </p>

            <h3>Existence</h3>
            <p>
                Within Imagination you have bits of the static that happen to hit a form of organization by pure chance and this forms what is known as Existence, or better known as the Walls of Existence. This is because Existence is often hollow, which allows things to reside within it safe from the chaotic static of Imagination. So from the inside, Existence looks like a huge and unending wall.
            </p>
            <h4>The 3 Enigmas</h4>
            <section>
                <p>
                    There are three ultimate powers in the Cosmic Plane that balance each other. These three are Deities, Reality, and Dragons. Deities overpower Dragons, Reality bridles Deities, Dragons predate Reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deities have direct streams of power to Imagination allowing the sheer power capable of overpowering Dragons. Deities don't rely on defined power, especially outside of Reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deities desire sensation and fulfillment and can only fulfill that through Reality. So they have to negotiate with Reality to be let in and as a result the power of a Deity becomes defined upon entering Reality. It is in this that Reality holds dominance over Deities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dragons know of the ancient formation of Reality and know secrets that even Reality is unaware of. Because Reality is dependent on specific and defined power, and with Dragons holding greater knowledge, they have great dominance over Reality. Dragons are the one entity that can reside within Reality and remain unaffected by Reality's power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dragons hold the dominant gene. Deities hold the dominant power. Reality holds the dominant environment. 
                </p>
            </section>
            <h3>Reality</h3>
            <p>
                Within Existence, Imagination can leak into it. When a large bit of Imagination leaks in it can become what is known as Reality due to the size of that Imagination. Since the Imagination is separated from the chaotic mass outside of Existence, the Imagination will take form: Reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reality is a semi-conscious presence of definition. Everything within it has definition; nothing undefined can reside within it. This means that only 3rd dimensional beings can reside fully in Reality. Reality communicates with the Walls of Existence to grant power to those who speak to Reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only Reality, Order, and Chaos can communicate with Existence.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Reality holding definition over everything within it, it holds rules in its communication. These rules are to prevent exploitation, loopholes, and to fulfill specific requests of Order and Chaos. 
            </p>
            <h4>Reality Representative</h4>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Reality is a conscious entity, which allows it to create its own rules for how most everything works within itself. People can speak to Reality and depending on the situation, Reality will listen to them. There are many people who are more adept at speaking to Reality but a select few people are able to listen to Reality. These people carry power to rival any Deity. The reason behind the level in which they hold power is because they are almost entirely one with the intents of Reality and they serve Reality diligently. Their requests/commands of Reality are also communicated perfectly. These people often act as representatives of Reality.
                </p>

            <h4>Rules of Reality—General</h4>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Can't place oaths on anything but yourself. (Reason: Exploit)
                </p>
                <p>
                    All nonverbal communication to Reality is labeled as Witchcraft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All verbal communication to Reality is labeled as Wizardry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The more powerful or big a spell, the more precise and correct it MUST be or else the consequences are dire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Incorrect communication of powerful spells never result in simply nothing happening, except in specific circumstances.
                </p>

            <h3>Order and Chaos</h3>
            <h4>Embodiments</h4>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Within Reality, there are 2 Embodiments: Order and Chaos. These Embodiments predate all Deities and exist as Reality exists. Although they predate the Deities and hold a tremendous amount of power superseding a Deity, they can fall into unconsciousness easily. Oftentimes when they are conscious they take that opportunity to find someone to carry out their work. Those who take on that power become their child.
                </p>

            <h3>Deities</h3>
            <a href="consciousness/known-deities.html"><h4>Known Deities</h4></a>
            <h3>Mortals</h3>
            <p>
                Mortals are categorized by the power one has over specific entities such as Deities. Mortals have a wide spectrum in terms of capability in ability and power, but despite this, no Mortal is capable of ever truly killing the consciousness of a Deity or any other nonMortal being, unless that Mortal becomes a Titan.
            </p>
            <h4>Titans</h4>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Titans are Mortals of incredible power, often overpowering the Three Enigmas. “Titan” is a title and not a species in any way. To be a Titan, a Mortal must gain power not categorized by level of power, but power on a nonMortal plane.
